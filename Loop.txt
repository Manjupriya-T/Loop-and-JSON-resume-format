1. JSON iterate over all for loops

*‘For’ Loop
	The For Loop comes first because of its simplicity and ease of use.
	It is a very user-friendly kind of loop that runs with a method of using a counter. 
eg:
	var marks = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
	for(let i=0; i<marks.length; i++){
		console.log( i, marks[i]);
	}

*‘For In’ Loop
	Another way of looping is the For In Loop. Unlike the For Loop, this loop won’t be using a counter. So this makes
	the whole process even more simple and hassle-free. In fact, the For In Loop is essentially a simplified version of the For Loop.
eg:
	var player = {
    name:"Gukesh D",
    game:"chess",
    age:16,
    rating:2699,
    title:"Grandmaster",
};

for (var key in player){
    console.log(key, player[key]);
}

*'for of' Loop
	To loop through a JSON array with JavaScript, we can use a for of loop.
eg:
	var marks = [ 99, 80, 60, 50]
for (var val of marks){
    console.log(val);
}

*'forEach' Loop
	This method is used for looping through an array element.
eg:
	var marks = [ 99, 80, 60, 50]
marks.forEach(function (mark){
    console.log(mark);
})
